# Stock Market Application

## Description

This is a project I designed in my second semester of college. This is a JavaFX application that allows you to trade any stock with an initial set of fake money. 
Every user can create/login to their own account and trade stocks. It is important to note that the stock data is not received in real time. 
The data is received from Yahoo Finance. The application downloads a CSV file containing the stockâ€™s history and takes the most recent price and assigns 
that as the price of the stock in the application. This project helped me become more familiar with the Java language as well as introduce me to other technologies 
that are commonly used to make Java GUI applications such as JavaFX and SceneBuilder.
